This project’s goal is to find out the answer of
question”Should I go to see the movie Frozen2?” by analyzing
2000 tweets scraped from twitter. I divided this question to two
questions. First one is by getting the score of a sentiment analysis
to see how people feel about this movie. Second, by finding
out the top 50 word to see how people describe this movie. By
go thorough sentiment analysis and exploratory analysis, most
people feel not bad about this movie and they used many good
word to describe this movie. So, the final answer for the question
is that Frozen2 is a movie worth to see.
